# Your Community, Your Commute, Your Safety.


# Overview 

# This year's theme for RecessHacks 5.0 was independence. Drawing from our own experiences, we found travel to be one of the most meaningful aspects. As we become more independnt, we travel without supervision more frequently and so our parents are concerned about safety. We created this app to alleviate the stress by helping people find the safest and best transportation that is avalaible to them.
